You sit there for a few seconds before realizing, oh right, you’ve got a mask on! Your phone doesn't recognize you. </p>\n<p>The reason? For facial recognition to work, it has to be able to detect what makes your face unique. The technology turns that information into numbers. Yep, hate to break it to you, but each of our lovely faces can be represented through something like a massive spreadsheet filled with digits. Meanwhile, long before you’re sitting there trying in vain to get past your phone’s pesky password screen, <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170930030634/https://images.apple.com/business/docs/FaceID_Security_Guide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">tech companies</a> have already converted millions and millions of other faces into number sets to create a humongous database for comparison.

Some of us are only now realizing the role that face-tracking apps play in our everyday lives because our features are suddenly hidden behind masks all the time. The state of being \"unseen\" is hardly new for communities that algorithms consistently fail to recognize. The miracle of unlocking digital and sometimes physical doors is operated by algorithms that exhibit bias and inaccuracies <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"http://gendershades.org/overview.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">relative to race and gender.</a></p>\n<p>Facial recognition takes various forms ranging from seemingly harmless to dystopically disastrous. Some say technology just automates processes that are already in place, but there’s mounting evidence that recognition systems can heighten existing biases and perpetuate systemic racism.</p>\n<p>Here at YR Media, we’ve been looking into <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://yr.media/tech/guide-to-anti-surveillance-fashion/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">creative ways to dodge and trick facial detection and surveillance for some time now</a>. Using projectors, dramatic make-up and all sorts of other hacks, activists have paved the way with anti-recognition techniques that also make a broader statement about technology in our <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://tacticaltech.org/#/about\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">data-driven world</a>.

If you see multiple matching faces in your results, check out the percentage listed. That’s a “similarity score,” and it shows just how confident the software is that each face is a match. “For many law enforcement use cases, we recommend using a high threshold value of 99% or above to reduce accidental misidentification,” states Amazon Rekognition’s developer guide. And as of June 2020, the company announced a one-year moratorium on police use of their facial recognition technology (more on that below). While these recommendations seem to acknowledge that the technology is fallible, <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/acial%20Recognition%20and%20Biometric%20Technology%20Moratorium%20Act.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">guidelines aren’t consistently enforced</a>. Also, keep in mind that when facial recognition technology is implemented at a massive scale — say, if an entire country uses it across their whole population — even tiny changes in confidence can mean the system could very well be identifying the wrong person.</p>\n<p>You may have noticed we’ve given you pre-uploaded photos to see how much info facial recognition technologies need to work well.

In fact, an investigation by the Center on Privacy &amp; Technology at Georgetown Law showed that <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/half-of-all-american-adults-are-in-a-police-face-recognition-database-new-report-finds/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">half of American adults are in facial recognition databases that can be accessed by law enforcement agencies. </a>And with multiple <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2019/NIST.IR.8280.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">studies</a> showing that facial recognition is more likely to misidentify darker-skinned people and only a <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://www.banfacialrecognition.com/map/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">handful</a> of cities banning use of public surveillance programs, we run the risk of making serious mistakes that disproportionately harm our black populace.</p>\n<p>Rollbacks from tech giants further emphasize the need for accountability and responsibility when using facial recognition technologies. In the wake of Black Lives Matter protests following George Floyd’s murder, even before Amazon announced its moratorium, <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/policy/facial-recognition-sunset-racial-justice-reforms/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">IBM</a> declared that it would “sunset” facial recognition and analysis products. “IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values,” said IBM CEO Arvind Krishna in an open letter to Congress. </p>\n<p>We asked <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/aads/faculty/sb28889\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Simone Browne</a>, professor at University of Texas, Austin and author of <a class=\"link green underline underline-hover hover-dark-green\" href=\"https://www.dukeupress.edu/dark-matters\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness</a>, a few of our lingering questions about the state of facial recognition today.</p>","slug":"you-are-being-watched"}],"interview":{"biopicture":"images/bio_picture.jpg","bookpicture":"images/book.jpg","questions":[{"question":"What does your work primarily focus on?","response":"I am a researcher, an educator and writer. My research is mainly on surveillance. I approach looking at surveillance, which is quite interdisciplinary, from a black studies perspective.\nI try to draw some connections between the past and how it can allow us to ask some important questions about our present. And those important questions could be: What are ways that people resist these technologies? What ways were these technologies, ways of identifying people, but also attempting to make people into objects that could be controlled in a particular way? Do we want to be included in these technologies that are often used in very repressive ways? \nA lot of research and development is still under a frame of scientific racism. Those long histories are not behind us. They still form the social conditions and intellectual logics of how these technologies are framed.\nThere are all of these ways that it might be designed to have a certain type of body in mind and that body is often a light body. It's often a male body. It makes certain bodies legible and other parts and pieces of bodies illegible. Gender or race are key ways of identifying people. It doesn't recognize black people. It recognizes white men at a higher degree."},{"question":"What makes facial recognition better than the other security technologies we use?","response":"I guess the question is what do we need to be secure from? Who is the “we” and what can we do better? Who is being policed in particular ways? Who is being jailed or incarcerated? And will facial recognition change that when it's tied to policing? Or will it allow police then to say’ “The algorithm was the one that did this, not me.”?\nThere are all of these ways of knowing who somebody is, regardless of their face, whether or not it's masked up. What happens when we identify the bag that you have, the shoes that you have, your tattoos? All of these things are part and parcel of policing. Think of all the data that you're putting about yourself from your LinkedIn profile to your Etsy purchases to your Yelp comments to your Facebook. All of that is a parcel of who you are digitally in the world. There are still ways in which we are captured by the things we do that might be beyond facial recognition technology, but other types of biometrics that are tied in with the digital data footprint we leave in the online world."},{"question":"Who gains from using facial recognition technologies?","response":"Through popular culture, people develop a certain type of consent to these technologies because they seem to make our lives a bit easier. And for some people, there’s the idea that they're always under threat, always in need of protection and that surveillance technology will save them. That's an easy tradeoff to say, ‘Sure, I'm going to have this Ring doorbell because I want to be nosy, but also I'm okay with the police having access to it at all times or Amazon selling that data."},{"question":"We’re starting to see companies like IBM and Amazon put limits around how facial recognition technologies are being used. What do you make of this?","response":"I think those are important steps. \nWe have to understand the past of this company to be a bit skeptical of their pauses. And for me, it's like, “OK, they're pausing now. What are they working on?” Amazon and IBM are not going to stop being capitalists. They are not just going to stop making money.\nI think this pause points to a lot of work that's being done by activists, by artists, by researchers, by educators, by people that have been really pushing back in cities, at the municipal level to abolish these technologies. So, while there is this pause, the pressure has to stay on."}]}}]}
